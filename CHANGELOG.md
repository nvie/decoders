Please see the [migration guide](./MIGRATING-v2.md) for precise instructions on how to
adjust your v1 code.

The main change is the brand new `Decoder<T>` API! The **tl;dr** is:

Implementation changes:

-   Major reorganization of internal module structure
-   Various simplification of internals

## v1.25.5

## v1.23.3

-   Returned objects that are the result from `object()`, `inexact()`, and `exact()`
    decoders will no longer contain explicit `undefined` values for optional keys, but
    instead those keys will be missing in the returned object entirely. (#574, thanks
    @w01fgang!)

## v1.23.2

-   Add missing exports for `nonEmptyArray` and `nonEmptyString` (for TypeScript)

## v1.23.1

-   Include an error code with every FlowFixMe suppression (Flow 0.132.x compatibility)

## v1.23.0

-   **New decoders:**

    -   [`json`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#json): decodes any valid JSON value

    -   [`jsonObject`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#jsonObject): decodes any valid
        JSON object

    -   [`jsonArray`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#jsonArray): decodes any valid JSON
        array

## v1.22.2

-   **New decoders:**

    -   [`inexact()`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#inexact): like object, but retain
        any extra fields on the input value as `unknown`

    -   [`iso8601`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#iso8601): for decoding
        ISO8601-formatted date strings

-   **Improved type inference** for `object()` and `exact()` decoders (see #515, thanks
    @dimfeld)

-   `DecoderType` is now an alias for `$DecoderType` (to support both TypeScript and Flow
    conventional naming)

-   `GuardType` (and `$GuardType`) is a new type function to extract the type of a guard
    instance

## v1.21.0

-   **New decoder** [`lazy()`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#lazy): lazily-evaluated
    decoder, suitable to define self-referential types.

-   Fix compatibility with Flow 0.127.0

## v1.20.2

-   Fix compatibility with Flow 0.126.0+

## v1.20.1

## v1.20.0

-   Fix issue where infinite recursion occurs when input object (the object being
    validated) contains a circular reference

## v1.19.1

-   Republish due to an NPM outage

## v1.19.0

**New decoders:**

-   To complement the tuple family of decoders, there's now also `tuple1` (thanks
    @sfarthin!)

## v1.18.1

-   Also fix Flow type bugs when Flow option `exact_by_default=true` in `debrief`
    dependency

## v1.18.0

**New decoders:**

-   `nonEmptyString`: like `string`, but will fail on inputs with only whitespace (or the
    empty string)

-   `nonEmptyArray`: like `array`, but will fail on inputs with 0 elements

**Fixes:**

-   Fix Flow type bugs when Flow option `exact_by_default=true` is enabled

## v1.17.0

May cause breakage for Flow users:

-   Fix subtle bug in `object()` and `exact()` Flow type definitions that could cause Flow
    to leak `any` under rare circumstances.

## v1.16.1

-   Internal change to make the code Flow 0.105.x compatible. Basically stops using array
    spreads (`[...things]`) in favor of `Array.from()`.

## v1.16.0

**New feature:**

-   Allow `map()` calls to throw an exception in the mapper function to reject the
    decoder. Previously, these mapper functions were not expected to ever throw.

## v1.15.0

**New features:**

-   Support constructors that have required arguments in `instanceOf` decoders in
    TypeScript (see #308, thanks @Jessidhia!)
-   Add support for type predicates in `predicate()` in TypeScript (see #310, thanks
    @Jessidhia!)

**Fixes:**

-   Add support for Flow >= 0.101.0

## v1.14.0

**Potential breaking changes:**

-   Stricten `pojo` criteria. Now, custom classes like `new String()` or `new Error()`
    will not be accepted as a plain old Javascript object (= pojo) anymore.

**Fixes:**

-   Add support for Flow 0.98+

## v1.13.1

**Fixes:**

-   Don't reject URLs that contains commas (`,`)

## v1.13.0

**Breaking changes:**

-   Changed the API interface of `dispatch()`. The previous version was too complicated
    and was hardly used. The new version is easier to use in practice, and has better type
    inference support in TypeScript and Flow.

    **Previous usage:**

    ```
    const shape = dispatch(
        field('type', string),
        type => {
            switch (type) {
                case 'rect': return rectangle;
                case 'circle': return circle;
            }
            return fail('Must be a valid shape');
        }
    );
    ```

    **New usage:**

    ```
    const shape = dispatch('type', { rectangle, circle });
    ```

    Where `rectangle` and `circle` are decoders of which exactly one will be invoked.

*   Removed the `field()` decoder. It was not generic enough to stay part of the standard
    decoder library. (It was typically used in combination with `dispatch()`, which now
    isn't needed anymore, see above.)

*   `pojo` decoder now returns `Decoder<{[string]: mixed}>` instead of the unsafe
    `Decoder<Object>`.

**Fixes and cleanup:**

-   Internal reorganization of modules
-   Improve TypeScript support
    -   Reorganization of TypeScript declarations
    -   More robust test suite for TypeScript
    -   100% TypeScript test coverage

## v1.12.0

**New decoders:**

-   `oneOf(['foo', 'bar'])` will return only values matching the given values
-   `instanceOf(...)` will return only values that are instances of the given class. For
    example: `instanceOf(TypeError)`.

## v1.11.1

-   Reduce bundle size for web builds
-   New build system
-   Cleaner package output

## v1.11.0

**Potentially breaking changes:**

-   Decoders now all take `mixed` (TypeScript: `unknown`) arguments, instead of `any` üéâ !
    This ensures that the proper type refinements in the implementation of your decoder
    are made. (See migration notes below.)
-   Invalid dates (e.g. `new Date('not a date')`) won‚Äôt be considered valid by the `date`
    decoder anymore.

**New features:**

-   `guard()` now takes a config option to control how to format error messages. This is
    done via the `guard(..., { style: 'inline' })` parameter.

    -   `'inline'`: echoes back the input value and inlines errors (default);
    -   `'simple'`: just returns the decoder errors. Useful for use in sensitive contexts.

-   Export `$DecoderType` utility type so it can be used outside of the decoders library.

**Fixes:**

-   Fixes for some TypeScript type definitions.
-   Add missing documentation.

**Migration notes:**

If your decoder code breaks after upgrading to 1.11.0, please take the following measures
to upgrade:

1. If you wrote any custom decoders of this form yourself:

    ```javascript
    const mydecoder = (blob: any) => ...
    //                       ^^^ Decoder function taking `any`
    ```

    You should now convert those to:

    ```javascript
    const mydecoder = (blob: mixed) => ...
    //                       ^^^^^ Decoders should take `mixed` from now on
    ```

    Or, for TypeScript:

    ```javascript
    const mydecoder = (blob: unknown) => ...
    //                       ^^^^^^^ `unknown` for TypeScript
    ```

    Then follow and fix type errors that pop up because you were making assumptions that
    are now caught by the type checker.

2. If you wrote any decoders based on `predicate()`, you may have code like this:

    ```javascript
    const mydecoder: Decoder<string> = predicate(
        (s) => s.startsWith('x'),
        'Must start with "x"',
    );
    ```

    You'll have to change the explicit Decoder type of those to take two type arguments:

    ```javascript
    const mydecoder: Decoder<string, string> = predicate(
        //                               ^^^^^^ Provide the input type to predicate() decoders
        (s) => s.startsWith('x'),
        'Must start with "x"',
    );
    ```

    This now explicitly records that `predicate()` makes assumptions about its input
    type‚Äîpreviously this wasn‚Äôt get caught correctly.

    TypeScript users.

## v1.10.1

-   TypeScript support

## v1.10.0

**Breaking:**

-   Private helper function `undefined_or_null` was accidentally exported in the package.
    This is a private API.

## v1.9.0

**New decoder:**

-   `dict()` is like `mapping()`, but will return an object rather than a Map instance,
    which may be more convenient to handle in most cases.

**Breaking:**

-   `optional(..., /* allowNull */ true)` has been removed (was deprecated since 1.8.3)

## v1.8.3

**New decoder:**

    on

## v1.6.0

        superfluous keys (keys that aren't in the object definition).

## v1.5.0

-   Collect and report all nested errors in an object() at once (rather than error on the
    first error).

**Breaking:**

-   Remove deprecated `message` argument to `object()`

## v1.4.6

-   Add missing documentation

## v1.4.5

-   Upgrade second-level dependencies

## v1.4.4

-   Declare library to be side effect free (to help optimize webpack v4 builds)
-   Upgrade dependencies

## v1.4.1

-   Improve internals of the error message serializer (debrief)

## v1.4.0

-   **New decoders!**
    -   `email` validator based on the
        [almost perfect email regex](http://emailregex.com/)

    -   `anyUrl` validator for validating any URL scheme

## v1.3.1

-   Fix bug where dates, or arrays (or any other Object subclass) could pass for a record
    with merely optional fields.

## v1.3.0

-   Much improved error messages! They were redesigned to look great in terminals and to
    summarize only the relevant bits of the error message, striking a balance between all
    the details and the high level summary.

## v1.2.4

-   **New features**:
    -   `truthy` takes any input and returns whether the value is truthy
    -   `numericBoolean` takes only numbers as input, and returns their boolean
        interpretation (0 = false, non-0 = true)

## v1.2.2, v1.2.3

-   **New feature** `mixed` decoder, for unverified pass-thru of any values

## v1.2.1

-   **Fix** Expose the following decoders publicly:
    -   `integer`
    -   `positiveInteger`
    -   `positiveNumber`

## v1.2.0

## v0.1.1

-   Export `g2d()` helper function that can help adoption to new-style APIs by converting
    old-style decoders (now called guards) to new-style decoders.

## v0.1.0

-   **Breaking change** New API: simplified names, split up decoders from guards. What
    used to be called "decoders" in 0.0.x ("things that either return a value or throw a
    runtime error") are now called "guards" in 0.1.0. The meaning of the term "decoders"
    is now changed to a thing that either is an "Ok" value or an "Err" value.

    To convert to the new API, do this:

    ```javascript
    // Old way
    import { decodeNumber, decodeObject, decodeString } from 'decoders';

    const decoder = decodeObject({
        name: decodeString(),
        age: decodeNumber(),
    });

    // -------------------------------------------------------------------

    // New way
    import { guard, number, object, string } from 'decoders';

    const guard = guard(
        object({
            name: string,
            age: number,
        }),
    );
    ```
