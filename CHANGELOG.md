## [Unreleased]

- Upgrade all dependencies

## [2.4.0] - 2024-01-21

**New features:**

- A new `.pipe()` method on `Decoder` allows you to pass the output of one decoder into
  another:
  ```tsx
  string
    .transform((s) => s.split(',')) // transform first...
    .pipe(array(nonEmptyString)); //   ...then validate that result
  ```
  This was previously possible already with `.then`, but it wasn't as elegant to express.
- The new `.pipe()` can also dynamically select another decoder, based on the input:
  ```tsx
  string
    .transform((s) => s.split(',').map(Number)) // transform first...
    .pipe((tup) =>
      tup.length === 2
        ? point2d
        : tup.length === 3
          ? point3d
          : never('Invalid coordinate'),
    );
  ```
- Decoder error messages will now quote identifiers using single quotes, which makes them
  more human-readable in JSON responses. Compare:
  ```
  "Value at key \"foo\": Must be \"bar\", \"qux\""  // ‚ùå Previously
  "Value at key 'foo': Must be 'bar', 'qux'"        // ‚úÖ Now
  ```
- Some runtime perf optimizations

**New decoders:**

- `identifier` ([docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#identifier))
- `nanoid()` ([docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#nanoid))

**Removed decoders:**

- Remove `numericBoolean` decoder, which was deprecated since 2.3.0.

## [2.3.0] - 2024-01-09

**New features:**

- All `enum` types are now supported ([docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#enum_))
- Record decoder now supports both `record(values)` and `record(keys, values)` forms
  ([docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#record))
- Add `datelike` decoder ([docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#datelike))
- Add support for `bigint` ([docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#bigint))
- Add built-in support for common string validations
- Better support for symbols in `constant()` and `oneOf()`

**New decoders:**

- `enum_` (see [docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#enum_))
- `record()` (see [docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#record))
- `select()` (see [docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#select))
- `bigint` (see [docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#bigint))
- `datelike` (see [docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#datelike))
- `decimal` (see [docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#decimal))
- `hexadecimal` (see [docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#hexadecimal))
- `numeric` (see [docs](https://decoders.cc/api.html#numeric))

**Renamed decoders:**

Some decoders have been renamed because their names were based on Flowisms. Names have
been updated to better reflect TypeScript terminology:

- `dict()` ‚Üí `record()`
- `maybe()` ‚Üí `nullish()`
- `set()` ‚Üí `setFromArray()` (to make room for a better `set()` decoder in a future
  version)

**Deprecated decoders:**

The following decoders are deprecated because they were not commonly used, and a bit too
specific to be in the standard library. They are also scheduled for removal in a future
decoders version.

- `dict()` (prefer `record()`)
- `hardcoded()` (prefer `always()`)
- `maybe()` (prefer `nullish()`)
- `mixed` (prefer `unknown`)
- `numericBoolean()`

**Other changes:**

- Fix: `positiveNumber` and `positiveInteger` no longer accept `-0` as valid inputs
- Fix: `either` return type would sometimes get inferred incorrectly if members partially
  overlapped (see #941)
- Reorganized internal module structure
- Simplified some of the more complicated internal types

## [2.2.0]

**Breaking change:** Dropped Flow support\*.

**Breaking change:** Projects that are not yet using `strict: true` in their
`tsconfig.json` files files are _no longer supported_. Previously, decoders went to great
lenghts to support both configurations, but the internal typing magic was getting too
complex to maintain without much benefit.

**Breaking change:** A small breaking change is introduced that removes the need for some
packaging workarounds to support projects using old TypeScript/Node versions. It‚Äôs now
simpler to use, and simpler to maintain:

```diff
-import { formatInline, formatShort } from 'decoders/format'; // ‚ùå
+import { formatInline, formatShort } from 'decoders'; // ‚úÖ
```

```diff
-import { Result, ok, err } from 'decoders/result'; // ‚ùå
+import { Result, ok, err } from 'decoders'; // ‚úÖ
```

Other, smaller changes, mostly internal:

- Rewritten source code in TypeScript (previously Flow)
- Rewritten test suite in Vitest (previously Jest)
- Modern ESM and CJS dual exports (fully tree-shakable when using ESM)
- Further [reduced bundle size](https://bundlephobia.com/package/decoders)
- Related, greatly simplified complex internal typing magic to make it work in projects
  with and without `strict` mode.

(\*: I'm still open to bundling Flow types within this package, but only if that can be
supported in a maintenance-free way, for example by using a script that will generate
`*.flow` files from TypeScript source files. If someone can add support for that, I'm open
to pull requests! üôè )

## [2.1.0]

- Officially drop Node 12 and 14 support (they may still work)
- Fix unintentional inclusion of `lib.dom.d.ts` in TypeScript

## [2.0.5]

- The returned value for `positiveInteger(-0)` is now `0`, not `-0`
- The returned value for `positiveNumber(-0)` is now `0`, not `-0`

## [2.0.4]

- Fix a bug in the `url` decoder, which could incorrectly reject URLs with a `/` in the
  query path. Thanks, @gcampax!

## [2.0.3]

- Fix bundling issue where TypeScript types would not get picked up correctly in old
  TypeScript versions. Thanks, @robinchow!

- ![](./docs/assets/tiny-ts-logo.png) Fix TypeScript types for `Result` type to allow
  implicit-undefineds.

## [2.0.2]

- ![](./docs/assets/tiny-ts-logo.png) Fix TypeScript types for `formatShort` and
  `formatInline` helper functions

## [2.0.1]

- ![](./docs/assets/tiny-ts-logo.png) **TypeScript-only:** Fix definition of JSONObject to
  reflect that its values might always be `undefined` as well.

- ![](./docs/assets/tiny-ts-logo.png) **TypeScript-only:** Changed return types of
  `{ [key: string]: T }` to `Record<string, T>`.

- ![](./docs/assets/tiny-ts-logo.png) **TypeScript-only:** Fine-tune the type of
  [`instanceOf()`](https://decoders.cc/api.html#instanceOf).

## [2.0.0]

This is a breaking change, which brings numerous benefits:

- A **simpler API** üòá
- Smaller **bundle size** (67% reduction üò±)
- **Tree-shaking** support üçÉ
- Runtime **speed** üèéÔ∏è
- Better documentation üìö

Please see the [migration guide](./MIGRATING-v2.md) for precise instructions on how to
adjust your v1 code.

The main change is the brand new `Decoder<T>` API! The **tl;dr** is:

## [1.23.2]

- Add missing exports for `nonEmptyArray` and `nonEmptyString` (for TypeScript)

## [1.23.1]

- Include an error code with every FlowFixMe suppression (Flow 0.132.x compatibility)

## [1.23.0]

- **New decoders:**

  - [`json`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#json): decodes any valid JSON value

  - [`jsonObject`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#jsonObject): decodes any valid JSON
    object

  - [`jsonArray`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#jsonArray): decodes any valid JSON
    array

## [1.22.2]

- **New decoders:**

  - [`inexact()`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#inexact): like object, but retain any
    extra fields on the input value as `unknown`

  - [`iso8601`](https://github.com/nvie/decoders#iso8601): for decoding ISO8601-formatted
    date strings

- **Improved type inference** for `object()` and `exact()` decoders (see #515, thanks
  @dimfeld)

- `DecoderType` is now an alias for `$DecoderType` (to support both TypeScript and Flow
  conventional naming)

- `GuardType` (and `$GuardType`) is a new type function to extract the type of a guard
  instance

## [1.21.0]

- Also fix Flow type bugs when Flow option `exact_by_default=true` in `debrief` dependency

## [1.18.0]

**New decoders:**

- `nonEmptyString`: like `string`, but will fail on inputs with only whitespace (or the
  empty string)

- `nonEmptyArray`: like `array`, but will fail on inputs with 0 elements

**Fixes:**

- Fix Flow type bugs when Flow option `exact_by_default=true` is enabled

## [1.17.0]

May cause breakage for Flow users:

- Fix subtle bug in `object()` and `exact()` Flow type definitions that could cause Flow
  to leak `any` under rare circumstances.

## [1.16.1]

- Internal change to make the code Flow 0.105.x compatible. Basically stops using array
  spreads (`[...things]`) in favor of `Array.from()`.

## [1.16.0]

**New feature:**

- Allow `map()` calls to throw an exception in the mapper function to reject the decoder.
  Previously, these mapper functions were not expected to ever throw.

## [1.15.0]

**New features:**

- Support constructors that have required arguments in `instanceOf` decoders in TypeScript
  (see #308, thanks @Jessidhia!)
- Add support for type predicates in `predicate()` in TypeScript (see #310, thanks
  @Jessidhia!)

**Fixes:**

- Add support for Flow >= 0.101.0

## [1.14.0]

**Potential breaking changes:**

- Stricten `pojo` criteria. Now, custom classes like `new String()` or `new Error()` will
  not be accepted as a plain old Javascript object (= pojo) anymore.

**Fixes:**

- Add support for Flow 0.98+

## [1.13.1]

**Fixes:**

- Don't reject URLs that contains commas (`,`)

## [1.13.0]

**Breaking changes:**

- Changed the API interface of `dispatch()`. The previous version was too complicated and
  was hardly used. The new version is easier to use in practice, and has better type
  inference support in TypeScript and Flow.

  **Previous usage:**

  ```
  const shape = dispatch(
      field('type', string),
      type => {
          switch (type) {
              case 'rect': return rectangle;
              case 'circle': return circle;
          }
          return fail('Must be a valid shape');
      }
  );
  ```

  **New usage:**

  ```
  const shape = dispatch('type', { rectangle, circle });
  ```

  Where `rectangle` and `circle` are decoders of which exactly one will be invoked.

* Removed the `field()` decoder. It was not generic enough to stay part of the standard
  decoder library. (It was typically used in combination with `dispatch()`, which now
  isn't needed anymore, see above.)

* `pojo` decoder now returns `Decoder<{[string]: mixed}>` instead of the unsafe
  `Decoder<Object>`.

**Fixes and cleanup:**

- Internal reorganization of modules
- Improve TypeScript support
  - Reorganization of TypeScript declarations
  - More robust test suite for TypeScript
  - 100% TypeScript test coverage

## [1.12.0]

**New decoders:**

- `oneOf(['foo', 'bar'])` will return only values matching the given values
- `instanceOf(...)` will return only values that are instances of the given class. For
  example: `instanceOf(TypeError)`.

## [1.11.1]

- Reduce bundle size for web builds
- New build system
- Cleaner package output

## [1.11.0]

**Potentially breaking changes:**

- Decoders now all take `mixed` (TypeScript: `unknown`) arguments, instead of `any` üéâ !
  This ensures that the proper type refinements in the implementation of your decoder are
  made. (See migration notes below.)
- Invalid dates (e.g. `new Date('not a date')`) won‚Äôt be considered valid by the `date`
  decoder anymore.

**New features:**

- `guard()` now takes a config option to control how to format error messages. This is
  done via the `guard(..., { style: 'inline' })` parameter.

  - `'inline'`: echoes back the input value and inlines errors (default);
  - `'simple'`: just returns the decoder errors. Useful for use in sensitive contexts.

- Export `$DecoderType` utility type so it can be used outside of the decoders library.

**Fixes:**

- Fixes for some TypeScript type definitions.
- Add missing documentation.

**Migration notes:**

If your decoder code breaks after upgrading to 1.11.0, please take the following measures
to upgrade:

1. If you wrote any custom decoders of this form yourself:

   ```javascript
   const mydecoder = (blob: any) => ...
   //                       ^^^ Decoder function taking `any`
   ```

   You should now convert those to:

   ```javascript
   const mydecoder = (blob: mixed) => ...
   //                       ^^^^^ Decoders should take `mixed` from now on
   ```

   Or, for TypeScript:

   ```javascript
   const mydecoder = (blob: unknown) => ...
   //                       ^^^^^^^ `unknown` for TypeScript
   ```

   Then follow and fix type errors that pop up because you were making assumptions that
   are now caught by the type checker.

2. If you wrote any decoders based on `predicate()`, you may have code like this:

   ```javascript
   const mydecoder: Decoder<string> = predicate(
       (s) => s.startsWith('x'),
       'Must start with "x"'
   );
   ```

   You'll have to change the explicit Decoder type of those to take two type arguments:

   ```javascript
   const mydecoder: Decoder<string, string> = predicate(
       //                               ^^^^^^ Provide the input type to predicate() decoders
       (s) => s.startsWith('x'),
       'Must start with "x"'
   );
   ```

   This now explicitly records that `predicate()` makes assumptions about its input
   type‚Äîpreviously this wasn‚Äôt get caught correctly.

  old-style decoders (now called guards) to new-style decoders.

## [0.1.0]

- **Breaking change** New API: simplified names, split up decoders from guards. What used
  to be called "decoders" in 0.0.x ("things that either return a value or throw a runtime
  error") are now called "guards" in 0.1.0. The meaning of the term "decoders" is now
  changed to a thing that either is an "Ok" value or an "Err" value.

  To convert to the new API, do this:

  ```javascript
  // Old way
  import { decodeNumber, decodeObject, decodeString } from 'decoders';

  const decoder = decodeObject({
    name: decodeString(),
    age: decodeNumber(),
  });

  // -------------------------------------------------------------------

  // New way
  import { guard, number, object, string } from 'decoders';

  const guard = guard(
    object({
      name: string,
      age: number,
    }),
  );
  ```
