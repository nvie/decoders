/**
 * Elm-like JSON decoders, for use with Flow.
 * See http://elmplayground.com/decoding-json-in-elm-1 for an introduction.
 *
 * Why? All JSON responses coming from our API endpoints are just that: free-form
 * JSON data.  To Flow, the only type classification possilbe is "any" -- effectively
 * turning off all type checks for anything related to JSON.  To the receiving end
 * (our frontend), the structure of that data is completely opaque to any type 
 * checkers since JSON values can be anything: an object, an array, null, a string,
 * a bool, etc.  Our type system is not a runtime type system, so we need a way of
 * "converting" an any-type JSON value into a type that we want to work with in our
 * frontend code base.
 *
 * Elm's solution to this problem is to define composable decoders: functions that
 * take anything and either fail with an error, or guarantee to return the expected
 * type.  In our case, it's fine to fail with a runtime error.
 *
 * For example a string decoder will:
 *
 * decodeString('ohai')      => 'ohai'
 * decodeString(false)       => RUNTIME ERROR
 * decodeString({foo: 123})  => RUNTIME ERROR
 * decodeString(null)        => RUNTIME ERROR
 *
